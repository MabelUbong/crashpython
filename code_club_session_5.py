## Looping Through a Range

### Introduction

Use a for loop to print the numbers zero to four
"""

counter_variable = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]

Use a for loop to print the numbers two to five

for counter_variable in range(5):
  print(counter_variable)

"""We can do the same thing for a while loop but it is longer"""

counter = 0
while counter < 5:
  print(counter)
  counter += 1

"""### Standard Puzzles

Use a for loop to print the number -5 to 5, inclusive
"""

for counter in range(-5,6):
  print(counter)

"""Print the first ten square numbers"""

for num in range(1,11):
  print(num**2)

"""### Bonus Puzzles

Experiment with passing a third argument into `range(...)`. What does it do?
"""

for nums in range(1,11,2):
  print(nums)

"""It prints out the numbers from 1 to 11 in twos

Use this technique to count down from ten to zero
"""

"""## Looping Through a List

### Introduction

Create a shopping list and print out each item in a sentence
"""

                 "eggs", "apples"]

Calculate the product of the elements in a list (see the presentation for a similar example)
"""

"""## Early-stopping

### Introduction

Print the elements of a list until a negative number is encountered, at which point you should stop
"""

### Introduction

Use enumeration to print out the elements of a list alongside their ordinal indices
"""

Define the list shown in the presentation
