# Crash Python
My worked examples for WDSS Summer Python Course.
WDSS’s Beginner’s Python course is designed for anyone completely new to Python or even programming in general. The course is self-contained and approaches the language in a slow and friendly manner, assuming no prior knowledge. All of the resources are free to be used by anyone, though WDSS do offer teaching and mentorship for this course to make learning even easier. 
I am using this to start my journey through getting to an advance level of Python.
