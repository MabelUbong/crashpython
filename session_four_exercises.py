"""You can think of this as a sort of mapping, where the value of a given index tells you which index to look at next. For example index zero contains the value $26$ so we'd next look at index $26$. This has value $60$ so we'd then look at index $60$, etc.

It is not hard to show that if you continue following this rule, you'll eventually get back to where you started. It would be interesting to know how many steps this takes.

Ask the user for an index to start from and then follow the rule until you get back to the start, keeping track of how many steps this takes.

You will want to define a variable `steps` to keep track of how many steps you've taken as well as a variable `curr_value`, initial set to the starting value, to hold the current value you are looking at. You should keep looping until `curr_value == start_value` and `steps >= 1`. The last condition is needed to ensure that you don't immediately exit the loop. On each loop iteration you can increment the step count and update the current value to be `mapping[curr_value]`. Have a go at tying these ideas together into a solution.
